**`Software Developer`**
- üìú Hi there! I'm a software developer working on mobile apps. I've worked on apps that belong to some of the topmost companies & brands in the world, that are being used by millions of users. Although I began developing apps over a decade ago for BlackBerry & Nokia devices, I've since transitioned to working on building apps solely for the iOS platform. I've also dabbled with Java & the Android platform in a limited personal capacity for some pet projects.
- üå± I'm fascinated by technology and always interested in learning something new. I‚Äôm currently learning web development using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, MongoDB etc in order to develop web apps for some ideas that I have in mind with the intent of making these accessible from any device. I'm also looking at learning React & Svelte next, but I'm undecided on which one I'd go with first. If you prefer one over the other, let me know!
- ‚òïÔ∏è In my free time I like gaming on the Xbox, watching movies and shows as well as reading. Also, I love coffee!
- üìß Email is the best way to get in touch with me: anupdsouza@gmail.com
